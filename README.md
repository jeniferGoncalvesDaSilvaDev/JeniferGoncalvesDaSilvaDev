âš¡ **Fun fact**: I'm a teacher of animal and human anatomy. I love science, music, anime, movies, series, and technology. I'm an ethical hacker (yeah, I live for hacking) and a maker (building things you imagine) as a hobby. I love the cyberpunk world, I'm a Potterhead from Slytherin House, and I like 80's, 90's, and 2000's culture and anime. I'm a huge fan of *The Matrix* (I think I'm Neo). I also have a big love for animals, especially cats.
